---

NzbDAV is a **WebDAV server** that mounts NZB documents as a browsable virtual filesystem — without downloading full media files first. Content streams on demand, straight from your Usenet provider.

It also exposes a **SABnzbd-compatible API**, so Sonarr, Radarr, and similar tools can use it as a drop-in download client. Combined with Plex, Emby, or Jellyfin, this lets you build an effectively infinite media library without storing the full media library on your server.

## Why another fork?

This project is a maintained fork of [nzbdav-dev/nzbdav](https://github.com/nzbdav-dev/nzbdav). We took ownership of the full Usenet streaming stack — nzbdav, UsenetSharp, RapidYencSharp, rapidyenc, and SharpCompress — so playback, connection, and decoding fixes could land in the right layer instead of waiting on a single upstream dependency chain.

Read the full story in the [release announcement](https://nzbdav.github.io/nzbdav/release-announcement/).

## Quick start

NzbDAV ships as a single Docker image. Use the `latest` tag for the newest release, or `lts` for a slower, more conservative release cycle that lags one feature release behind `latest`. To try it out:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/nzbdav/nzbdav:latest
```

This trial command is ephemeral: its settings are discarded when the container exits.

For a persistent setup, use Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  nzbdav:
    image: ghcr.io/nzbdav/nzbdav:latest
    container_name: nzbdav
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      PUID: "1000"
      PGID: "1000"
      TZ: Etc/UTC
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000`, create your admin account, and head to the **Settings** page to configure your Usenet provider:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Port `3000` serves plain HTTP. If NzbDAV will be reachable outside your trusted network, put it behind an HTTPS reverse proxy and do not expose the container port directly to the internet. WebDAV uses Basic authentication, so TLS is essential for remote access. When the proxy runs on the Docker host, bind the port to localhost with `127.0.0.1:3000:3000`.

You'll also want to set a username and password for the WebDAV server itself.

## Documentation

Full documentation is published at [nzbdav.github.io/nzbdav](https://nzbdav.github.io/nzbdav/).

The [0.7.x release announcement](https://nzbdav.github.io/nzbdav/release-announcement/) summarizes the coordinated stack releases (nzbdav, UsenetSharp, RapidYencSharp, rapidyenc), .NET 10 migration, network performance work, and our audit of upstream issues and PRs.

The [comprehensive setup guide](https://nzbdav.github.io/nzbdav/setup-guide/) covers everything needed for a full production deployment:

* **Docker Compose** — persistent deployment, container health checks, and updates
* **Import strategies** — Rclone symlinks for Plex or STRM files for Emby/Jellyfin
* **Performance tuning** — benchmarking WebDAV connection limits
* **Integrations** — automating Radarr/Sonarr queue management and repairs
* **Stremio** — streaming Usenet on demand via AIOStreams
* **Search profiles** — token-scoped Newznab, Addon, and JSON adapter setup
* **Watchtower** — proactive wanted-list resolution and readiness controls in the [Watchtower guide](https://nzbdav.github.io/nzbdav/watchtower/)

## Development

The project consists of a .NET backend (WebDAV, Usenet streaming, SAB API) and a React Router frontend (admin UI). See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for local development setup and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for release history. Source for the published docs lives in [`docs/`](docs/).
